PR_Runner is a calculator that, when given initial NP concentration, initial bacteria concentration, initial NP-PR concentration, and intended time elapsed, will give out the final NP concentration. 

ReversePR_Runner is a calculator that, when given initial and target NP concentration, initial NP-PR concentration, and intended retention time, will give out the final bacteria concentration. 

Biofilm_Runner is a calculator that, when given initial nanoparticle concentration, velocity of water in contact with biofilm, total volume of container, time for biofilm to be in contact with NP solution, and number of biocarriers used, will give out the resulting NP concentration.

ReverseBiofilm_Runner is a calculator that, when given initial and target nanoaparticle concentration, velocity of water in contact with biofilm, total volume of container, time for biofilm to be in contact with NP solution, will give out the amount of biocarriers needed.

All units are included with the program. Insert as many digits as possible for a more accurate result. To view the code of each .jar files, unzip then use your favorite IDE to view.
