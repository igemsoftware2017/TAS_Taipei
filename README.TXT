USER INSTRUCTIONS: 

PR_Runner is a calculator that, when given initial NP concentration, initial bacteria concentration, initial NP-PR concentration, and intended time elapsing, will give out the final NP concentration. 

ReversePR_Runenr is a calculator that, when given initial and target NP concentration, initial NP-PR concentration, and intended retention time, will give out the final bacteria concentration. 

Biofilm_Runner is a calculator that, when given initial and final volume, initial and targeted final NP concentration, velocity of water in contact with biofilm, and total biofilm-NP contact time, will give out the surface area of biofilm needed.

All units are included with the program. Insert as many digits as possible for a more accurate result.
